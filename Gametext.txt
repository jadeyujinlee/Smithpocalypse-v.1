You wake up in King House one day to hear
yelling and chaos outside your door. 
Confused, you look outside the window to see 
that zombies have taken over campus! Your 
friend calls you to tell you to meet them at 
Chase/Duckett, where they’ve made a safe 
house. Your objective is to make it to 
safety by making the right choices and being 
at the right place at the right time. You 
get ready to leave and walk out of your room.
Will you:
A. Try to make a dash to saftey across campus
B. Head toward Park house to gather supplies


You run into a swarm of zombies. With no way 
to fight them, you are soon bitten and die. 
GAME OVER

You exit into the Quad and begin to walk 
towards Park House when you encounter a 
group of zombies coming at you from your 
left. Will you:
A. Run
B. Fight the zombies

You manage to narrowly esape the zombies. As 
you're walking by the pond on the way to 
Park house, you spot some rope on the ground 
but Oh No! It's next to a group of Zombies!
Will you:
A. Risk it and try to grab the rope
B. Keep going to Park House and leave 
the rope there

It seems you didn't think this through. 
You don't have any supplies to fight with 
yet. You get bitten and die. GAME OVER

You grab the rope in a narrow escape from a 
swinging zombie arm. You make it to Park 
House and use it to put yourself into a tall 
window. Will you:
A. Go down to the kitchen to find food
B. Search for supplies

You make it to Park House without a rope and 
find that all entrances are blocked. 
Unfortunately, the zombies eat you alive. 
GAME OVER

There was a zombie awaiting you in the 
kitchen. Silly, there is a dining hall in 
Chase/Duckett where you're headed. You get 
eaten. GAME OVER

You find a softball bat, a first aid kit, 
and a bottle of water. The zombies outside 
have all congregated in a big gaggle. Will 
you:
A. Try to tie the zombies together using the 
rope
B. Hit them with the bat and rely on your 
stength to save you

This was foolish. You can't tie zombies 
together with a rope. You get eaten and die. 
GAME OVER.

CHECKPOINT PASSED. You nearly don’t make it, 
but since you’re fast and quick on your feet,
you were able to defend yourself and make it 
to the crosswalk, walking past the ‘Smith 
College’ sign. You must now decide what to 
do next. Will you:
A. Make a Dash for Chuckett
B. Try to get to the Campus Center 

Haven't you learned your lesson by now? 
You encounter a hoard of zombies and die. 
GAME OVER

A group of zombies crosses the street and is 
heading towards you. Will you:
A. Try to fight them off
B. Run to the campus center away from them

You fight well with your bat and manage to 
kill all the zombies. However, when you try 
to open the Elm Street door it's locked. 
Will you:
A. Try to find another way in
B. Keep going to Chuckett

You manage to use your bat to break open a 
window. You make your way inside and block 
the opening with a chair. You will:
A. Go downstairs to find something 
useful in the mail room
B. Go to Student Engagement Office 
and try to contact outside world

There is a zombie waiting for you 
downstairs. It jumps out at you and 
you do not survive. GAME OVER

You find that the internet has been 
disconnected. You leave a note for any 
possible surviors. Oh no! Because you broke 
a window, a zombie managed to get in! Will 
you:
A. Fight it
B. Try to sneak away

You fight it and narrowly manage to escape. 
However, because of the kerfuffle with the 
zombie, you neglected to see a horde of 
zombies coming from the direction of the 
town and you do not survive.

In planning your next route, you take too 
long and the zombie manages to sneak up on 
you. You should’ve covered all your bases.


You run towards the Elm Street side entrance 
and find that it’s locked! Will you:
A. Find another way in
B. Panic

I guess you have given up. How lame, you are 
eaten. GAME OVER

You run over to the other entrance and find 
that a door has been wedged open! You make 
your way inside and lock the door behind 
you. Will you:
A. Buy snacks from vending machine
B. Go to student enagement office to 
make outside contact

You're kidding me right? There's food at 
chuckett. You area eaten by a swarm of angry 
zombies. GAME OVER

You break into the office and find all wifi 
is down and there is no power. You decide to 
leave a note for any possible survivors 
coming this way and take a small rest as you 
plan your next route. You see a horde of 
zombies coming from the direction of the 
town and decide your best bet is to run to 
either Seelye or Neilson. CHECKPOINT PASSED. 
This is the final moment of decision, will 
you:
A. Head toward Neilson and Seelye
B. Go to Chuckett before it's too late

You are strong, but unfortunately you swing 
and miss. You struggle but are bitten and 
eaten. GAME OVER

Healing the zombies and befriending them 
proved ineffective. The zombies attack and 
you die. GAME OVER

Which do you use: softball bat, first aid 
kit or water bottle? Type exactly as written.

You try to test if the wifi is online by 
entering the password for the Smith Wifi

You manage to narrowly avoid the horde of 
zombies by running past their backs. It’s a 
good thing they’re slow! You reach Neilson 
first, but find that the door is locked. 
Will you: 
A. Run around to the other entrance
B. Make a dash for Seelye

You find that the other door is also locked. 
Exhausted, you try to pry it open but a 
zombie overtakes you and you die. GAME OVER

You run into your professor on the way to 
Seelye and they try to give you advice about 
survival. While you listen, a zombie comes 
up behind you and eats you. GAME OVER.

You make your final break and start booking 
it past the bus stop. You have to swing a 
couple of times to get some zombies out of 
the way. Suddenly, one LUNGES at you, this 
one seems particularly enthusiastic. Will 
you:
A. Turn back towards the saftey of the CC 
B. Try to fight it

You turn around to see the hoard of zombies 
you were fleeing from earlier. That's what 
you get for being a coward. GAME OVER.

You swing once, which was just enough to 
stun it, but after a second or two of a 
headstart it begins to run at you. Quick! 
Will you:
A. Tip over the newspaper stand to try and 
slow it down
B. Use one of your supplies

You don’t quite get the momentum right and 
were unable to tip it over. The zombie 
catches up and catches you. GAME OVER.

It hits him right in the head and knocks him 
back a few feet! Great! Now you can run a 
little faster and you’re almost there! Will 
you:
A. Swing at him one more time
B. Book it faster

You miss and it gets you in one foul swoop. 
GAME OVER.

You make it to the door! Will you:
A. Break the door open with your bat
B. Bang on the door

Did you forget the zombies are fast? The 
zombies eats you before anyone can open the 
door. GAME OVER.

You make it in but he follows you! Luckily 
there’s a hoard of other survivors with 
their own bats and weapons to quickly subdue 
the threat and board up the door. You have 
accomplished the mission. A sigh of relief 
comes out from your lips. But wait! You 
still need to make it to the bus stop.
