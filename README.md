# Smithpocalypse-v.1

This was a final project game about a zombie-apocalypse at Smith College. Our task was to utilize several different data structures, such as dictionaries, graphics (greg), Classes, and inheritance. The player chooses between two choices which furthers or ends their adventure. 

Several files are just pictures used for the graphics in the final "boss" challenge at the very end of the game.
